<h1> Golf in 2D! </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

This project features a 2D Golf game made using the open-source Godot engine. All gameplay functionality was written using GDScript (very similar in syntax to C#) and Godot's own API. This page details highlights of some of the elements included in the game prototype along with a breakdown of how certain features were implemented. Godot was chosen as it is open-source, community-driven and written with C++, a language that I am confident with. This allowed me to develop an insight into understanding the inner workings of a game engine, particularly with regards to the simulation of physics. I also created a fun game prototype out of it, of course!

<h4> Interactive elements </h4>

All interactive elements share a common interface. All have setters and getters. Class doesnt call its own setter to not get stuck in loop.
